    <h1>Our Story</h1>

    <h2>Berrily was born in 2021 after friends Maja, Malin, Sigridur and Priscilla returned from a trip to Italy, the birthplace 
    of gelato. Inspired by the exquisite flavours and ingredients they encountered, they decided to bring the concept to Sweden 
    and design all their flavours after the traditional Italian recipe. The name “Berrily” comes from the four friends’ love for 
    berries of the forest, one of the most common fruits found in Swedish nature and the base of many of our signature ice creams. 

    Today Berrily has three stores in Sweden (Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg), two in the United States (Los Angeles and NYC) and plans 
    to open a new store in Tokyo, Japan in the Spring of 2022. </h2>
